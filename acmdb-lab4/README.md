# SimpleDB Lab-4 Doc

- Exercise 1: the implementation of `IntHistogram ` is not hard. However, it is worth noting that `buckets` may be larger than `max-min+1`, which may cause the width of bars to be 0 if we conduct a careless division. 
- Exercise 2: I construct a histogram for each field as long as it is of integer or string type. 
- Exercise 3: I just apply the formulas mentioned in the document.
- Exercise 4: to implement Selinger, the pseudocode is nice. By following it I finish this exercise.

I did not make any essential changes to the API in this lab.

I spent approximately two days on it. I do not find any extreme trouble here.
